### Installation

You can install the package from [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/) and autoload it:

```lisp
(autoload 'ido-at-point-mode "ido-at-point")
```

Otherwise, if installed manually:

```lisp
(require 'ido-at-point)
```

Then activate the mode:

```lisp
(ido-at-point-mode)
```

### Usage

Press <kbd>M-tab</kbd> or <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> to start completion.

### Alternative completion front-ends

If you fancy using **helm** instead of **ido**, re-define the `ido-at-point-read` function:

```lisp
(require 'helm-mode)
(defun ido-at-point-read (choices common)
  (helm-comp-read "" choices
                  :initial-input common
                  :must-match t))
```

### Compatibility

Works only in Emacs 24 and higher. Compatible with Emacs Lisp mode, Tern, Shell mode and hopefully many others.

If you use Emacs 24.4 (the next release), checkout the branch [*next*](https://github.com/katspaugh/ido-at-point/tree/next).
